# Aussie Broadband Dev Challenge
For this dev challenge we are going to create a Wordle clone (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

You will be creating a frontend and API to create a functioning Wordle clone. We have provided a Laravel installation for you with a blank Vue component you can use for your game board. 

## Setup

To get going, you'll need to run the following commands


```
composer install
```
